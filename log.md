# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Housing price prediction problem, spent a lot of time on Data and finally able to train model
**Thoughts**: working on data is really interesting, tried linear regresion, decission tree regressor, random forest with cross validation but still a good model need to find

### Day 2: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fine tuning the model using Grid search method
**Thoughts**: will use Random search and regularize to couter the overfiting problem
