# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Housing price prediction problem, spent a lot of time on Data and finally able to train model

**Thoughts**: working on data is really interesting, tried linear regresion, decission tree regressor, random forest with cross validation but still a good model need to find

### Day 2: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fine tuning the model using Grid search method

**Thoughts**: will use Random search and regularize to couter the overfiting problem

### Day 3,July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to learn about different optimization techniques

**Thoughts**: Just a learning phase, using different optimization and to know how and where to use them is really great

### Day 4: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: some data visualization, and testing on different algorithm and finally fine tune them

**Thoughts**: when you're working on a machine learning project it is really necessary to work on data very very well, if your data is good enough and you have a great insight of it then the couple of algorithm will do your work, and ofcourse the optimization techniques.

### Day 5: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going deeper to the regression and learn more about regression, all thanks to the articles posted in analyticsvidhya.com 

**Thoughts**: Skill test on analyticsvidhya for linear regression and logistic regression. And the scores are as follows.
* Linear Regression: 26/30
* Logistic Regression: 24/30

**Due to Health issues I was unable to hold the challenge for 2days.

### Day 6: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried SVR with Grid search and Randomized search for house price prediction problem.

**Thoughts**: After using SVR with Grid search, the results were not better than Random forest, will look more into it and will find what I can do.

### Day 7: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent time on Google colabrotary, and floydhub setup

**Thoughts**: Tried floydhub cloud service, and use it for my basic house price machine learning model but I dont find it much faster. Though I used the free service for now.

### Day 8: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A day on reading Chapter 6 of ISLR, subset selection, stepwise selection method and choosing optimal method.

**Thoughts**: Before approaching a non linear way we should check all possibilites with the linear so this is what I learned, selecting important features for a linear model is very important.

### Day 9: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: started working on a new project, classification of hand written digits using MNIST dataset.

**Thoughts**: So today I thougt before working on multiclass, I should work on single digit means a binary classfication. so far so good, confusion matrix as performance measure. Mention that to measure confusion matrix i used kfold crossvalidation.

### Day 10: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on binary classification for MNIST, did some more performance measure. 

**Thoughts**: Binary classification of digit recognition is about to finish, but before that I want to spend a little more time on exploring and visualizing data, and then will approach for multilabel classification task.

### Day 11: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: More time spent on confusion matrix, precision-recall trade off

**Thoughts**: almost 2-3 days on confusion matrix and still hang on it. The matrix is so simple but the  info that need to obtain is bit trickt. You need to figure out when precision is important and where recall. obviously you can opy for f1 score but those two are really need to be taken care off.
