# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 1: July 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Housing price prediction problem, spent a lot of time on Data and finally able to train model
**Thoughts**: working on data is really interesting, tried linear regresion, decission tree regressor, random forest with cross validation but still a good model need to find

### Day 2: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on fine tuning the model using Grid search method
**Thoughts**: will use Random search and regularize to couter the overfiting problem

### Day 3,July 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to learn about different optimization techniques
**Thoughts**: Just a learning phase, using different optimization and to know how and where to use them is really great

### Day 4: July 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: some data visualization, and testing on different algorithm and finally fine tune them
**Thoughts**: when you're working on a machine learning project it is really necessary to work on data very very well, if your data is good enough and you have a great insight of it then the couple of algorithm will do your work, and ofcourse the optimization techniques.

### Day 5: July 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going deeper to the regression and learn more about regression, all thanks to the articles posted in analyticsvidhya.com 
**Thoughts**: Skill test on analyticsvidhya for linear regression and logistic regression. And the scores are as follows.
* Linear Regression: 26/30
* Logistic Regression: 24/30
